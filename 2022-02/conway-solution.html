            Conway inspired me with his playful approach toward mathematics.
            He passed away from COVID in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very new at making hunt-style puzzles. I hope it wasn't too frustrating to solve.

        <h2>Look and Say</h2>
        <p>
            This puzzle is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence">look-and-say sequence</a>, which was studied by Conway.
            Undo 5 iterations of look-and-say to get a number A repeated B times.
            Sort by A and read B to get the answer <b>VOICE</b>.

        <h2>Pentominoes</h2>

        <p>
            Pentominoes are usually refered to using Solomon Golomb's naming scheme, but Conway proposed an elegant alternative that uses consecutive letters from O to Z.
            Identify the pictures and Conway's pentomino names. There is exactly one difference in letter for each picture.
            Sort by picture's wrong letter and reading the wrong pentomino names reveal the answer <b>SPROUTS</b>, a combinatorial game created by Conway.

        <h2>Winning Ways</h2>
        <p>
            This puzzle is depicting game states of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush">Hackenbush</a>,
            a combinatorial game created by Conway.
            A detailed analysis of the game can be found in chapter 7 of "Winning Ways for Mathematical Plays", which was coauthored by Conway 
            (and Hackenbush is shown on the cover of the latest edition of the book),
            but the given game states are small enough to just brute force by hand.
            Reading the unique winning moves yields <b>NIMBER</b>, which is a number system used to evaluate
            the positions of Green Hackenbush and other impartial games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>META: Atlas of Sporadic Groups</h2>
        <p>
            This last part is refering to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_group">sporadic groups</a>,
            where Conway had significant contribution in their development.
            The diagram given is showing subquotient relations of the 26 sporadic groups
            (same diagram is given in the wikipedia page for sporadic groups).
        </p>
        <p>
            The title is also referencing <a href="http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/">ATLAS of Finite Groups</a>.
            Conway was one of the authors of the initial book version.
            The look of this puzzle is very close to the atlas site to confirm this lead.
            The page for sporadic groups gives us the order to match the letters in the feeder answers to sporadic groups,
            and the answer is <b>ICOSIANS</b>, yet another mathematical object created by Conway.
        </p>
        <object data="sporadic_groups_solution.svg" style="width: 400px;"></object>
        <p>
            Game of Life wasn't used in the puzzle, because Conway was annoyed by the fact that many people only knew him for it and nothing else.
